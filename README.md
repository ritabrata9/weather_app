## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Dart SDK (comes with Flutter)
- OpenWeatherMap API Key ([Get API key](https://openweathermap.org/api))

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd weather_app
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

3. Add API Key:

Create a file `lib/secrets.dart` (do **not** commit this file to GitHub) and add:
